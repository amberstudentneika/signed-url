# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute anything you want to to this repository! You're always welcome to leave 
an issue to describe the changes you want to make if you want to talk it through first.

All pull requests will be reviewed before merging, and must pass the test suite before being considered.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a pull request. Follow the pull request template

We will then review your code before merging. All pull requests must have done the following:

- Have been reviewed to ensure a good code quality
- Have comments where necessary
- Follow SOLID principles if it makes sense. We're not too strict on this, as long as your decision
has been backed up.
- Have changed the documentation if necessary.
- Have fully tested the new code. This can be through a mixture of unit and integration tests, but 
ensure you are confident the tests cover the new code and the old tests still run.
